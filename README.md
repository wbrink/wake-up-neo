# Wake Up Neo

Fictional website for the software company that Neo works for in the Matrix. After roughly seven seconds of opening the website, the wake-up-neo prompt appears which asks the user to pick red or blue pill. Blue pill keeps the original stylesheet while the red pill will change it to black and green color scheme.  

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* Javascript
* CSS
* Webpack 
* Anime.js 

## Choice

The choice of pill stays in local storage so that the user will have the same visual that they chose by default. However there is a toggle button in the header that allows you to switch without having to mess with local storage (the toggle doesn't effect the local storage). There is also a clear choice button that will restart the site (and remove choice in local storage) and do the animation over again.
